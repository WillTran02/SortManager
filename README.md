<h3>What is the SortManager?</h3>
<p>
The SortManager is an application that can be used to compare the time taken to perform a sorting operation using different Sorting Algorithms, when run against an array of length n (specified by the user).
</p>

<h3>How to use the SortManager</h3>
<p>

- Navigate to the <a href="src/main/java/com/sparta/wt/App.java">SortManager App</a>
- Run the program
- The program will ask you to choose a sorting algorithm
- After selecting an algorithm, the program will ask you to enter a number. This number will determine how large of a sample size to generate
- Next, the program will display the following information:
1. The size of the sample array, which will be populated with random numbers
2. The chosen sorting algorithm
3. The sample array again, sorted in ascending order
4. The time taken to complete the sorting operation
- The program will then proceed to ask you if you would like to repeat the program. Enter "Y" (case insensitive) to re-run the program, or anything else to exit the program.
